**Developing a website** for a customer could not be so easy and immediate as you think.

The process that take place when a new project is started is very complex and most of the time it includes **many
people** with **many ideas**. In the company I work for we're usual to build **official showcase websites**.

This means the **client has the final say** in everything that is not highly technical.

We also have a development and a production server; the first is locally available in the office, the last is in the
cloud.

Considering this, I've developed this workflow which is very successful (for now) and it's followed for the 99% of the
project we develop.

Recently we bought a decent connectivity so we moved the first client approval on our developing server.

Hi! my name is **Emanuele** but everybody calls me **Tex** or **Setola**, 
I'm a **DevOps Manager** and **System Architect** with a particular 
focus on **Cyber Security**; I was a **Web Developer** and an **IT Manager**.


I've started developing applications in early 2000, with languages like **C++** and **Java**. 
Then I've followed the web standard with **PHP** and **Node**, with a little trip to **GoLang**.

{{< heads-up 
  title="What I'm passionate about" >}}
  Technology is both the key point of my professional career 
  and my oldest hobby and of course one **passion** that takes me over the years.
  
  I like **Linux**, **OpenSource**, **Arduino** and **Raspberry PI** and **Kubernetes**
{{< /heads-up >}}


I've always been fascinated by the potential of the Internet, a passion that led me to face **either technical** or **design and marketing** topics.


I also developed a strong interest in **automation** and technology interactions with the physical world while exploring micro-controllers, IoT and CNC stuff


Outside work, I enjoy **riding my motorbike**, **cooking**, **playing drums** and **tactical games**. 


I also volunteer at NGI and GamesNet online communities helping managing games server and forums.

I am **Emanuele Tessore**, a **web designer**, an **IT developer** and definitely a **tech enthusiast**.  
This website is about my life, my work and my hobbies.  
I hope you will find something interesting here!

Some of my greatest tech interest are **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **WordPress**, **Arduino**, **Android**, but generally i
like everything has more than 10 transistors in it or you can write code for it.  
Actually I’m working as a **Dev-Ops** in a **communication agency** based in **Venice, Italy**.

If you’re interested in my professional career you can take a look on
my [resume](https://cv.emanueletessore.com/ "Emanuele Tessore - IT developer - Resume").  

This is not only my personal website, but also my code playground… where I test alpha code and things that can go boom…
so if you notice any issue feel free to contact me.

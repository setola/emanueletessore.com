Today I've noticed a little bug come out on my **WordPress network** running on a **Wordpress Multisite** configuration.

In the `admin bar` the `My Sites` menu **was showing the currently viewing blog** a number of times.

Further looking revealed me that for **every blog on the network** that link was **pointing to the current blog**.

My first thought was 'something went wrong while **updating WordPress to 3.5.1**'.

But I was wrong. The cause of this bug was **W3 Total Cache plugin**.

To restore the functionality of the My Sites menu i simply `network activated` W3TC and then **network deactived**.

And the bug was gone!
